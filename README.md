# YouTube Bot
## Increase views on your videos
YouTube Bot is a very simple to use python script that takes use of selenium to automate the process. All you need is:
- Python 3
- Web Browser (Chrome or Firefox)
- Selenium module
## How to execute?
- Firstly, Python 3 must be present in your system
- Then install selenium using pip: `pip install selenium`
- Download the apt Web Drivers (I have already included the drivers, so no need to worry)
- Add the URL of your YouTube video and hit Submit.
- Add the duration (specify how much the script should "watch" your video. Format is hh:mm:ss)
- Add the number of times you want to execute the script (mention inf for infinite).
- Execute
- If the video doesn't play, then comment out the `plybtn.click()` code segment and proceed from step 4
